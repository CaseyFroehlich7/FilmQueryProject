# FilmQueryProject


# Description
For this project we were tasked with creating a command-line application that retreives and displays film data. A menu was created for the user giving them the option to; search for a film using the film ID, search for a film using a keyword search, or they were able to exit the program. When the film is dispalyed, the program also shows the films title, release year, rating, language, description, and cast.

# Learning Opportunities
This was a great project to expose my lack of understanding on key componets of databases and how that information is utilized. I realized that I was my own worst enemy in learning this as I over complicated everything to a point where I had to go back through the material to get a better understanding. I am excited to continue to learn and have more hands on opportunites to further my understanding.
